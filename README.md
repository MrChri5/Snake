# Snake
**Snake Game**

This program is a console based game of Snake.
The snake `<ZZZZX` is controlled using the WASD or arrow keys. The aim is to eat as many apples `@` as possible without hitting walls or your own tail.
There are options to change the map layout, number of apples, and speed.


This project served as a further investigation into the uses of classes in C#. 
There is a Game class which stores data about each space on the screen and has methods for processing movement, printing the screen, and checking for Game Over.
There are also classed for the Snake and another for the Apples.
